# spectrum-web-components

Spectrum Web Components is a future-looking project to develop Adobe Spectrum design language based around web components, ES-Modules, and modern browser standards.

It will not support older browsers and will only target modern ever-green browsers that fully implement the Custom Elements V1 specification, e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari. Polyfills will be avoided as much as possible.

# Requirements

-   NodeJS >= 8.10.0
-   Typescript
-   Browsers with Custom Elements V1 and Shadow DOM support, e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari.

# Installation

```bash
yarn install
```

# Usage

```bash
yarn run serve
```

Browse to http://localhost:3000/dist/ to explore the distributed components, for example http://localhost:3000/dist/components/banner/demo/index.html contains the demo for the banner component.
